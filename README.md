# M.A.D Bot
M.A.D Bot is a little Discord bot for a small community.
If you're reading this, you're probably from that small community.

Here you can see all the progress, updates and source code for M.A.D Bot.

If you want to submit a bug or post a suggestion, hit the `issues` tab at the top there and press the green _"New Issue"_ button, type out your suggestion/bug then label it as a "bug" if it's a bug or label it as an "enhancement" if it's a suggestion. (The label option is to the right of where you type out your bug/suggestion). If I close the topic, that usually means it will be implemented.

Or you can just use **#suggestions,** I don't care.
